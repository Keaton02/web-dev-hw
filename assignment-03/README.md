Browers are pieces of software used to write instructions on the internet. They have their own languages like html, css and javsscript. They essentially ask for information from different severs all over the world and they fetch the information you're looking for. I use google chrome and safari.

A markup language is a system for annotating a document that can be read by computers. Since we can't write the same way we do in literature to a computer, we have to write in a way the computer understands. One example is HTML which is the foundation and structure to a pages content.
