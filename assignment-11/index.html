        <p> This is a paragraph. I'm not sure what to write so I'm about to ramble. Glasses on the table because they are right next to me. I'm not sure what else to say. I'm listening to music right now. I"m having trouble spelling. I can't type to save my life. This is supposed to be content for this webpage.</p>
<br>
        <p> Here'a another paragraph. This one maybe a bit shorter. Mainly because I'm watching a lot of disney plus at the moment and it's taking a lot of my time recently. But don't worry, I'll get this assignment done. I'm really excited to be graduating soon. I just hope these skills come in handy.
