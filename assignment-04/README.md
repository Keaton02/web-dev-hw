I decided to go onto imdb.com. It's was really interesting to see because the website almost hasn't changed at all. The layout and color scheme is the exact same as its always been. It is cool to see what movies and tv shows were poppin back then. Things like "9", and "Inglorious Bastards" were huge at the box office back then.

Everything is coming together on the modules. There's a few tiny steps like closing headers and stuff like that that I always forget but once we've practiced it enough times it makes sense.
