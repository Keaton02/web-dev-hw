    <h1>Lord Alfred Tennyson</h1>
    <hr>
    <p>Alfred Tennyson was bron in the depths of Lincolnshire, the fourth son of <thead>
      twelve children of the rector of Somersby, George Clyaton Tennyson, a cultivated
      but embittered clergyman who took out his disappointment on his wife Elizabeth and
      his brood children -on at least one occasion threatening to kill Alfred's brother.
      It was in part to escape from the unhappy environment of Somersby rectory that Alfred
      began writing poetry long before he was sent to school.
