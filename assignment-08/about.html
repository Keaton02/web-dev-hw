  <h1>What this means to me?</h1>
    <p> I've always been passionate about people expressing themselves in anyway they choose. YouTube is the best program to accomplish this. It's free and easy to use and has possibilites to earn money off content. Whether you're a first time user who wants to show a family memeber a cute video; or a professional looking to advance their career. The first step is uploading.</p>

    <p> Of course I'm just one person. There are many other great resources on website optimization. Here a great video!</p>
