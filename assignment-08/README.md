I had a little HTMl experience when I took a Dreamweaver class in high school. I quickly forgot all of it when I started college because Dreamweaver isn't even used anymore. But following along with the tutorials made everything very easy to understand.
I'm just worried that it isn't going to work. Type something wrong and I have no idea how to fix it. That sort of thing.
I came up with an idea that's really simple to teach someone. Even a four year old or an eighty year old can learn this simple task. Then I made sure I all all the required things like links and tables and forms and chekced that they all worked.
