Selector is the html element you want to modify. Declaration is what you want changed. id's are used when you want to make changes to a certain element but not all of them.
I wanted to choose a color palette that looked like a sunset of the 1970's. #E5E500, #A9A9A9, #660000, and classic oranges.
This assignment was very confusing. I think it would have made it a lot easier on myself if I used id's for each sections, but I feel like that isn't a fair way to do it. I just got so frustrated that things weren't working and that I didn't know the proper semantics for modifying each declaration.
