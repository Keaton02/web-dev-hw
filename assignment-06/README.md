Most of the time the forms I come across are the ones we use to submit assignments for school. We upload a link or a project file and there we go. Sometimes I come across forms that allow you to subscribe to a newsletter or something like that.
 "text" name=" name" id= "test-text" This might be used for a login. type="radio" name= "level" value= "Grad"  This may be used for applications. type ="submit" name= "Upload" This can be used for turning in an assignment.
My process is pretty simple. I look at what assets I need for the week, mainly photos, then I follow along with the walkthrough as best I can. Then I patch up any errors and stylize where I can. Then I check the website for additional info and finish the response Q's.
